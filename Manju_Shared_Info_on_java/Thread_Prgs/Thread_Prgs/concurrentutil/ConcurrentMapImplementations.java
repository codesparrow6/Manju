	 * ConcurrentMap interface represents a Map which is capable of handling concurrent access (puts and gets) to it.
	 * 
	 * ConcurrentHashMap is the only implementation of ConcurrentMap
	 * 
	 * ConcurrentHashMap does not lock the Map while you are reading from it. 
	 * Additionally, ConcurrentHashMap does not lock the entire Map when writing to it. 
	 * It only locks the part of the Map that is being written to, internally.
	 * 
	 * Another difference is that ConcurrentHashMap does not throw ConcurrentModificationException 
	 * if the ConcurrentHashMap is changed while being iterated. The Iterator is not designed to be used by more than one thread though.
