	 * ReadWriteLock is an advanced thread lock mechanism. It allows multiple threads to read a certain resource, but only one to write it, at a time.
	 * 
	 * The idea is, that multiple threads can read from a shared resource without causing concurrency errors. 
	 * The concurrency errors first occur when reads and writes to a shared resource occur concurrently, or if multiple writes take place concurrently.
	 * 
	 * Read Lock  :  If no threads have locked the ReadWriteLock for writing, and no thread have requested a write lock (but not yet obtained it). Thus, multiple threads can lock the lock for reading.
	 * Write Lock  :  If no threads are reading or writing. Thus, only one thread at a time can lock the lock for writing.
